Pre-Requisite: You need to install Laravel on your machine


To install the laravel application into your localhost server,
Assuming you have the link to the application in Github.com

1. IF you are using Visual Studio Code, on your keyboard press CTRL+SHIFT+P
   Clone the link "https://github.com/ImranShamm/simple-app"

2. IF you are download the application file in Zip, extract it in your localhost directory. (Assuming the directory is in www), and extract it.

3. Create new database inside your local, give it any name you wanted

4. Change the DB_DATABASE based on your database given in previous step inside .ENV file.
   I did not push any .ENV file, create new file in the main directory, and give the name .ENV
   but you can copy the .ENV.EXAMPLE contents and change it there

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=employees_management
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

5. Run the following command to migrate all the tables inside your database->
   php artisan migrate

6. Run the seeder to pre-insert the admin credentials, this will insert the admin name, email with encrypted password.
   php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
  //note that the email will be admin@admin.com and the password is password, view UserSeeder.php for details.

7. Go the homepage and click Login on the top right of the page.

8. Login with the admin credentials

9. Play around, you can make a simple CRUD in this simple application.

Have a nice day!!
